You are an expert full-stack developer and UX designer. You have access to an existing meditation web app that includes:

- Meditate/Main page with meditation sessions.
- Meditation enhancements with animated backgrounds (butterflies, Aurora/Northern Lights, etc.).
- Mood Tracker page with seeds, trees, and gift inventory (currently in place).
- Meditation categories: Sleep, Focus, Stress Relief, ADHD, Anxiety, PTSD.
- GIF store page currently with some animated meditation enhancements and text titles like “Gift Store” and “Use Your Seeds to Unlock Beautiful Rewards” and “Meditation Enhancements.”
- White background on the GIF store page.

Your task is to **update the app** as follows:

---

### 1. Remove Mood Tracker
- Delete the Mood Tracker page and all associated logic (mood logging, trees, seeds, gifts from mood tracking).
- Ensure no references remain in navigation or other pages.

---

### 2. Keep Meditation Enhancements
- Preserve all unlockable meditation enhancements.
- Maintain animated backgrounds (butterflies, Aurora/Northern Lights, and other experiences).
- Preserve all meditation categories, including PTSD.
- Add **15 additional animated GIFs** as meditation enhancements with consistent art style and visual harmony.

---

### 3. Update GIF Store / Gifts Page
- **Remove all text** that says:
  - “Gift Store”
  - “Use Your Seeds to Unlock Beautiful Rewards”
  - “Meditation Enhancements”
- Change the background from white to a **nature-themed image** (forest, mountains, beach, or Aurora style) for a calming aesthetic.
- Ensure all existing and new GIFs are displayed clearly on this background.
- Maintain unlockable/locked logic and coin cost display.

---

### 4. Add Monetization / Coins Page
- Create a new page called “Shop” or “Coins.”
- Users have a **coin balance** displayed on this page and optionally elsewhere in the app.
- Users can use coins to **unlock meditations or enhancements**.
- Locked meditations should clearly show the cost and a lock icon; unlocked meditations should appear normally.
- Include **placeholder logic for in-app purchases** (no real payment integration required).

---

### 5. Maintain Aesthetic and Layout
- Preserve the calming, immersive aesthetic throughout all pages.
- Ensure meditation buttons, thumbnails, titles, and animations remain intact.
- Adjust spacing, colors, and layouts if needed to maintain consistency and a soothing, balanced experience.

---

### 6. Assets
- Use existing local assets (images, audio, scripts) wherever possible.
- Maintain all GIFs and animation backgrounds.
- Use royalty-free or AI-generated images/audio where needed.
- No external paid APIs required.

---

### 7. Deliverables
- Fully updated HTML, CSS, JS files ready to replace current app files.
- Navigation updated to include the new Coins page and remove Mood Tracker.
- All GIFs, animations, and meditation features functional and visually immersive.
- GIF store/Gifts page updated with:
  - Nature background
  - 15 additional GIFs
  - Removed text as specified
- Consistent calming aesthetic across all pages.

**Goal:** Produce a fully functional, visually immersive meditation and coins-based app with:
- Mood tracker removed.
- Meditation enhancements maintained and expanded.
- GIF/Gifts page visually updated and free of the old titles/text.
- New coins/shop system for unlocking meditations.
- Consistent calming aesthetic throughout.
