You are an expert full-stack web developer and UX designer. Your task is to build a **complete meditation and mindfulness web app** with multiple pages and immersive, visually pleasing experiences. The app should include the following features and requirements:

---

### 1. Meditation Page
- The page lists multiple meditation sessions.
- Each meditation has:
  - A **unique, AI-generated or royalty-free nature background** (forest, beach, mountains, rain, etc.).
  - **Audio**:
    - Human voice guiding the meditation.
    - Constant nature sounds in the background (rain, wind, birds, etc.) that **cannot be paused**.
    - User can **play/pause the voice track independently**.
    - Voice and background audio can come from **royalty-free sources** or be AI-generated.
  - Simple **visualization** showing when the voice is active (e.g., a small animated waveform or indicator).
- User experience:
  - When entering a meditation, the user sees **only the nature background and audio**.
  - Meditations are categorized by focus (ADHD, sleep, relaxation, focus, stress, etc.).
- The page is visually immersive, like Calm, and responsive for mobile and desktop.

---

### 2. Mood Tracker Page
- Users select how they feel each day from multiple options (e.g., happy, stressed, calm, anxious).
- Visual representation:
  - A “tree” grows over time as users log their mood.
  - Positive days contribute **seeds** to the user’s inventory.
  - Seeds can be planted to grow **trees**, and planting is limited to one at a time.
  - Optional: display roots, branches, or leaves growing depending on mood progress.
- Gamification:
  - Seeds can also be exchanged in a separate “GIFT store.”
  - Gifts are **locked until enough seeds are collected**, showing a lock icon.
  - Clicking on a gift with enough seeds **unlocks it**, and the UI clearly shows unlocked vs. locked status.
- Visual style:
  - Use consistent, cohesive art style for trees, seeds, and gifts.
  - Track and display mood history visually on a timeline or interactive calendar.

---

### 3. GIFT Store Page
- Shows a **grid of gifts** that users can unlock with seeds.
- Locked gifts have a **lock icon**.
- Unlocked gifts have a clear visual indicator.
- All gifts use a consistent **AI-generated art style**.

---

### 4. Assets and Resources
- All audio and images should come from **free sources or AI-generated**.
- Backgrounds for meditations should be **AI-generated, nature-themed, high-resolution images or GIFs**.
- Meditations should have **human-sounding voice** (TTS or royalty-free recordings).
- All images and sounds should be included locally in the project or linked from free sources; **no paid APIs**.

---

### 5. App Structure & UI
- Use **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (or React if preferred) to build the front-end.
- Use a lightweight JSON database or local storage for:
  - Meditations metadata
  - Mood logs
  - Seeds and tree/gift progress
- Include a **main navigation menu** to switch between:
  - Meditation Library
  - Mood Tracker
  - GIFT Store
- Responsive design, visually immersive, smooth animations, Calm-like aesthetic.
- Include **all code and assets** so the app can be run directly in Replit or downloaded as a ZIP.

---

### 6. Deliverables
- Full project code with:
  - HTML/CSS/JS (or React files)
  - JSON or local storage setup for meditations, moods, and gamification
  - Preloaded placeholder meditation scripts, AI-generated or royalty-free audio references, nature backgrounds, and gifts
- Clear folder structure:
  - `index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, `audio/`, `images/`, `data/`
- Instructions to run the app directly in Replit or any static web host.

**Goal:** Produce a fully working, immersive meditation/mood app with gamified visual tracking, human-voiced meditations over constant nature sounds, and a consistent art style for backgrounds, gifts, and UI elements. All features must work without external paid services or APIs.
