Your task is to **update and enhance the app** with the following requirements:

---

### **1. Remove Titles**
- Remove the two titles at the top of the Meditate/Main page.
- Keep everything else on the page (button layout, thumbnails, durations, categories) exactly as it is.

---

### **2. Update Background**
- Change the background from white to a **blurred nature image** on the Meditate/Main page.
- Ensure that all text and buttons remain sharp and readable above the blurred background.
- Maintain a **visually immersive and calming aesthetic** consistent with apps like Calm.

---

### **3. Add Meditation Category**
- Add a new category: **PTSD**.
- Include this category wherever meditation categories are listed, selectable, or filterable.
- Ensure it integrates seamlessly with existing category styles and layouts.

---

### **4. Fix Aesthetic Issues Across All Pages**
- Review all pages (Meditate/Main, Mood Tracker, GIFT store, individual meditation experiences, etc.) for any design elements that could **break the calming, immersive feel**.
- Adjust colors, spacing, fonts, button shapes, backgrounds, and other visual elements as needed to ensure **consistency and a soothing, balanced experience**.
- Do not change functional elements unless necessary to improve aesthetic harmony.

---

### **5. Assets**
- Use existing local assets (images, audio, scripts) wherever possible.
- For the blurred nature background, include a placeholder image if necessary (e.g., `images/nature-blur.jpg`).
- No external APIs or paid resources should be required.

---

### **6. Deliverables**
- Provide fully updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files ready to replace the current app files.
- Maintain the appâ€™s existing structure, functionality, and layout.
- Ensure that the app runs exactly as before but with all requested updates applied and a consistent, calming aesthetic throughout.

---

**Goal:** Produce a fully functional, visually immersive meditation and mood-tracking app that:
- Has the top titles removed.
- Uses a blurred nature background.
- Adds a PTSD meditation category.
- Fixes any visual elements that would reduce calmness.
- Keeps all other functionality, layout, and interactivity intact.
